# Farrier-service-website
This was a school project where some code was provided initially as a coffee website, was required to change it to this farrier service website <br>
After downloading all of the files put them into one project in your desired software that can run HTML, I used brackets<br>
Run either the about.html, index.html, photogallery.html, products.html, or store.html and then use the built in navigation bar to explore the website
